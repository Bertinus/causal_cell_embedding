# DNase-Seq

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

DNase-seq (DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing) is a method in molecular biology used to identify the location of 
regulatory regions, based on the genome-wide sequencing of regions sensitive to cleavage by DNase I. FAIRE-Seq 
is a successor of DNase-seq for the genome-wide identification of accessible DNA regions in the genome. Both the 
protocols for identifying open chromatin regions have biases depending on underlying nucleosome structure. For example,
 FAIRE-seq provides higher tag counts at non-promoter regions. On the other hand, DNase-seq signal is higher at 
 promoter regions, and DNase-seq has been shown to have better sensitivity than FAIRE-seq even at non-promoter regions.

# ChIP-Seq

## What is ChIP-Seq?
By combining chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays with sequencing, ChIP sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is a powerful 
method for identifying genome-wide DNA binding sites for transcription factors and other proteins. Following ChIP 
protocols, DNA-bound protein is immunoprecipitated using a specific antibody. The bound DNA is then coprecipitated, 
purified, and sequenced.

The application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to ChIP has revealed insights into gene regulation events that play 
a role in various diseases and biological pathways, such as development and cancer progression. ChIP-Seq enables 
thorough examination of the interactions between proteins and nucleic acids on a genome-wide scale.


## Advantages of ChIP-Seq

Unlike arrays and other approaches used to investigate the epigenome, which are inherently biased because they require 
probes derived from known sequences, ChIP-Seq does not require prior knowledge. ChIP-Seq delivers genome-wide profiling
 with massively parallel sequencing, generating millions of counts across multiple samples for cost-effective, precise,
  unbiased investigation of epigenetic patterns. Additional advantages include:
- Captures DNA targets for transcription factors or histone modifications across the entire genome of any organism
- Defines transcription factor binding sites
- Reveals gene regulatory networks in combination with RNA sequencing and methylation analysis
- Offers compatibility with various input DNA samples

## How Does ChIP-Seq Work?

ChIP-Seq identifies the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins and can be used to map global binding sites for a 
given protein. ChIP-Seq typically starts with crosslinking of DNA-protein complexes. Samples are then fragmented and 
treated with an exonuclease to trim unbound oligonucleotides. Protein-specific antibodies are used to immunoprecipitate
 the DNA-protein complex. The DNA is extracted and sequenced, giving high-resolution sequences of the 
 protein-binding sites.
